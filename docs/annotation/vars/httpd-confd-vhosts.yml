  Configure virtual hosts. Create files.

task_httpd-confd-vhosts_description: |

  Use the filter `encode_apache <https://galaxy.ansible.com/jtyr/config_encoder_filters>`_ to
  configure virtual hosts. See the template vhost2.j2.  Take the YAML configuration files from the
  directory ``apache_confd_dir_vhosts`` (7) at master and create files with the Apache virtual hosts
  in the directory (32) at the remote host. The created files will be included in the configuration
  file (42).

  
  **Include data from conf.d (3-17)**

  Include tasks from the file ``al_include_confd_vars_list`` (12) in the role ``vbotka.ansible_lib``
  (11). This task takes as parameters the directory with the YAML configuration files (7) and the
  type of the list (8), and returns the list with the YAML configurations of the virtual hosts
  stored in the variable ``al_include_confd_vars_list``. The variable can be printed (16) when debug
  is enabled ``apache_debug: true`` (17). The parameters (7,8) are tested inside the included tasks.


  **Create directories for virtual hosts (25-27)**

  Include tasks from ``fn/httpd-confd-vhost-dirs.yml`` .


  **Configure virtual hosts in extra directory (29-38)**

  Create the Apache configuration files for the virtual hosts with the help of ``encode_apache``
  filter. Store the configuration file (32).


  **Include virtual hosts in httpd.conf (40-48)**
  
  Include virtual hosts in httpd.conf.
